# hbfi - Haskell Brainfuck Interpreter

A neater, more organised version of my Haskell Brainfuck Interpreter.

The original can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/raffitz/bf21fbfd4b898cdd7d0a2551bff8f26d).

## Usage

It reads one single command line parameter, which is the brainfuck code to be read.

It does not read code from __stdin__, as that is where it gets its IO from.
